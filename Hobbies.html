</p></ul>

        <ul><em><strong>James Brown</strong></em><p>James is the second oldest and a 
            great pyreneese. He is calm and sweet unless he 
            thinks someone is going to break into our property. 
            He loves to protect his family and will guard his loved ones. 
            He also loves naps.</p></ul>

            <ul><em><strong>Charlie Brown</strong></em>
            <p>Charlie is the youngest and smallest by far. 
                Being a corgi means having little legs. However, 
                being a corgi also means she loves food, and is 
                still very heavy. Charlie is the most playful and 
                most spunky, always going after her siblings to 
                wrestle.</p></ul>

<ul><em><Strong>Samantha Brown</Strong></em>
    <p>Miss Samantha Bear is the newest member of our pack 
        being adopted just his year. She is sweet and cuddly 
        which is sometimes hard because she is over 100lbs! She 
        loves food and her sister charlie.</p></ul>
